## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to detect **Fake News** using **Machine Learning models**.  
We trained classifiers on a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles, applying text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization) to improve accuracy.  

The system helps in identifying misleading or fake information and can be extended into real-world applications like **news portals, social media platforms, and fact-checking tools**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries & Tools**:  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Pandas, NumPy  
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)  
  - Jupyter Notebook  
  - Flask (for web deployment)

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ Preprocess text data using **NLTK**  
- ✅ Vectorize text with **TF-IDF**  
- ✅ Train ML models: **Logistic Regression & Passive Aggressive Classifier**  
- ✅ Detect if a news article is **Fake** or **Real**  
- ✅ Flask app for **real-time predictions**
